# Fifteen-Puzzle

The fifteen puzzle has 15 numbered puzzle pieces in a 4x4 grid, where one piece adjacent to the empty space can move to that empty space.

The user will receive a "congratulations!" message once he arranges the pieces in an ascending numerical order, but this message appears only if the puzzle has been shuffled.

I worked on this project the week Diablo3 was released. Hoping to play the game after I finish the project, I set a Diablo image as the background of the puzzle and added an extra feature to load the Diablo3 web page if the user succeeds in solving the puzzle.

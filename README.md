# Fifteen-Puzzle

The fifteen puzzle has 15 numbered puzzle pieces in a 4x4 grid, with each piece adjacent to the empty space able to move to where the empty space is.

The user will receive a "congratulations!" message once he arranges the pieces in an ascending numerical order, but this message appears only after the puzzle is shuffled.

I worked on this project the week Diablo3 was released, so hoping to play the game after I finish the project, I set a Diablo image as the background of the puzzle and added an extra feature to load the Diablo3 web page if the user succeeds in solving the puzzle.

HTML is provided by the course instructor, CSS and JavaScript are done by me.
